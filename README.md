Simple Login and Signup Page 🔐
This project provides a basic implementation of a login and signup page built with React. It allows users to sign up with their first name, last name, email, and password, and then log in using their email and password.

Features 🚀
Signup Page: Users can create a new account by providing their first name, last name, email, and password. Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.
Login Page: Registered users can log in using their email and password. Authentication is performed on the server-side to verify the user's credentials.
Error Handling: Proper error handling is implemented to provide feedback to users in case of invalid inputs or authentication failures.
Responsive Design: The login and signup pages are designed to be responsive and work well on various devices and screen sizes.
Technologies Used 💻
React: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: The backend server is built with Node.js, which allows for non-blocking, event-driven servers ideal for real-time applications.
Express.js: Express.js is used as the web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the process of building robust APIs.
MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the database to store user account information. User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
Axios: Axios is used to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API for user authentication and signup.
CSS: Custom CSS is used to style the login and signup pages for a clean and modern look.
